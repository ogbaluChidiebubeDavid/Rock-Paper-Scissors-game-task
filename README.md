# Rock-Paper-Scissors-game-task
Here the cpu makes a random choice from a list stored in a variable, this was possible with python Random module. 
The player also choses from the list too.
if player chose paper and cpu choses rock, then player won and vice versa.
if player chose scissor and cpu chose paper, the player won and vice versa.
if player chose rock and cpu chose scissors, then player won and vice versa.
if both player and cpu chose same item either rock rock, paper paper, scissors scissors, then its a tie and the game starts all over again.
Then if there is a winner or loser the game comes to an end but its within the power of the player to start the game all over by pressing 'y'.
if player presses anything outside y, it would cause the game to end.
Note: This is a command line game built with python Random module, while loop and 'if' 'elif' 'else' statements.
